```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm run-script build-docker
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Moreover, this uses a _hack_ to get a more optimized `npm` build by copying the dependencies over and only installing when the `package.json` itself has changed.  Look inside the `package.json` and the `Dockerfile` for more details on how this works.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)


#### docker-compose.yml

Change the path for the nginx conf mounting path to your full path, not mine!
